    "# LangGraph Agent for Digitial Twin\n",
    "The following project is an implimentation of prototype for a LLM based query system for data analysis paticularly for a digital twin. In the real world this is done at a large scale where we build a digital version of a complex infrastructure. This paticular implementation simplifies the problem to a case where there is just 1 building with 3 floors. Each floor has 3 rooms and each room has 4 sensors.\n",
    "The agent is build using langGraph which allows us to structre the whole system. By building such a structure we ensure that we are able to control the outcome of the output and allow for easier scalability and modification. \n",
    "For this project I have used use the openai gpt4.1 nano model. This model choice is just done due to limited availibility of resourses. When building a real system further experimentation is needed to decide a model. \n",
    "This notebook is divided into x major parts."

      "   - The result indicates that the room with the highest temperature sensor ID is **Room 644**, associated with sensor ID **t9**.\n",
      "   - Since sensor IDs are formatted as 't' followed by a number (e.g., t9), and the query orders by sensor ID descending, **t9** is the sensor with the highest ID, implying it is likely the latest or highest-numbered temperature sensor in the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Time Series Data Analysis:**\n",
      "   - The pandas DataFrame analysis identifies that the maximum temperature reading across all temperature sensors is from sensor **T6**.\n",

      "Final Answer:\n",
      "Based on the provided query results and data analysis, the floor with the highest average temperature and light levels during working hours (9 AM to 5 PM) is Floor 621 (which corresponds to Room 621).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key findings:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Average Temperature During Working Hours:**\n",
      "   - The pandas analysis indicates that the room with the highest average temperature in the specified time window is Room 621.\n",
      "   - The average temperature in Room 621 is approximately **25.17¬∞C**.\n",
      "   - Since Room 621 is on Floor 6, this suggests that **Floor 6** has the highest average temperature during working hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Average Light Levels During Working Hours:**\n",
      "   - Similarly, the highest average light level during working hours is also observed in Room 621.\n",
      "   - The average light level in Room 621 is approximately **58.46 units**.\n",
      "   - This again points to **Floor 6** having the highest average light levels during this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Supporting Data:**\n",
      "   - The cypher query results list sensor IDs and their types, confirming that each room has temperature and light sensors.\n",
      "   - The mapping of sensor IDs to rooms aligns with the room numbers, and the analysis explicitly filters for temperature and light sensors during working hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Floor 6** (Room 621) exhibits the highest average temperature and light levels during working hours (9 AM to 5 PM).\n",
      "- This conclusion is supported by the time series data analysis, which calculated the mean sensor readings per room and identified Room 621 as having the maximum averages in both categories.\n",

      "- The data provided does not include measurements outside the specified time window, so the conclusion strictly pertains to working hours.\n",
